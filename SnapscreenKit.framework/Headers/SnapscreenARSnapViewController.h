 SnapscreenARSnapViewController offers the snapping logic from Snapscreen to your application and enrich it via AR-like features. Instantiate via `SnapscreenKit` and then display it in your application. The recommended way to present the view controller is to present it as a modal view that covers the whole screen.
 
 Use the AR delegate callbacks to get information about the snapping process. In any case you are responsible to dismiss the view controller again.
 
 To customize the appearance of the viewfinder and zoom level indicator set the tintColor accordingly. To customize the color of the navigation bar and it's
 bar items use the default UIAppearance API calls.
 
 The snap button is automatically hidden in this view controller since AR only makes use of autosnapping.
 
 Please note that the standard SnapscreenSnapViewControllerDelegate (which is accessible via the view controller's delegate property) is not used in this case, but all relevant callbacks occur via the arDelegate.
