/**
 
 SnapscreenSnapViewController offers the snapping logic from Snapscreen to your application. Instantiate via `SnapscreenKit` and then display it in your application. The recommended way to present the view controller is to present it as a modal view that covers the whole screen.
 
 Use the delegate callbacks to get information about the snapping process. In any case you are responsible to dismiss the view controller again.
 
 To customize the appearance of the viewfinder, zoom level indicator and snap button, set the tintColor or the snapButtonImage accordingly. To customize the color of the navigation bar and it's
 bar items use the default UIAppearance API calls.
